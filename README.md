# My LunarVim Config

This is a port of my old neovim configuration to LunarVim.

LunarVim takes care of the essential functionality and leverages you the weight of maintaining core functionality breaking when installing or updating plugins.

## Install

Just [install LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/docs/installation). It will prompt you to install its dependencies: accept all of them.

## Philosophy
My IDE is not a playground, it's a curated set of needed functionalities.

I hate the feeling of being lost in my editor with so many plugins I don't know how to use. This is what this configuration takes care about.

## Configuration

Look at my [plugins]('./lua/user/general/plugins.lua') and you'll find the application of my philosophy.

Look at the [plugins' configuration]('./lua/user/plugin-config/') and you'll find I'm mostly customizing LunarVim's default functionality the way I like it.

## Thanks
Special thanks to [ChristianChiarulli](https://github.com/ChristianChiarulli/) for his work!

Have a good day,
